    <h3>house coffee blend</h3>
    <img src="./IMAGES/house blend.jpeg" width="250" alt="house blend">
    <p>House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop.
        Theyare generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend
        coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a
        house blend coffee,you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast and have
        intermediate flavor. Here at Carta Coffee, our house blends are our Captain's Roast and Meridian
        Roast coffees.

    <h3>french toast</h3>
    <img src="./IMAGES/french toast.jpeg" width="250" alt="french toast">
    <p>French roast coffee beans offer a distinct charcoal-like flavour that some find sweet and smoky. It's much darker
        than other light roast coffees, so the fundamental flavours of each bean are often disguised by the taste of its
        roast instead. As such, regional characteristics within different types of coffee beans tend to be hidden due
        to this strong dark roast flavour overpowering them. Contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee has a higher
        caffeine content than French roast. This is due to the fact that roasting creates heat which renders some of
        the molecules in the beans inactive or "burned." Therefore, when it comes time for your morning cup of joe,
        don't forget that lighter roasts can give you more of an energy boost. French roast coffee beans boast a low
        caffeine content due to their extensive roasting process, making them the perfect selection for anyone seeking
        an espresso with less of a jolt.

    <h3>columbia toast</h3>
    <img src="./IMAGES/colambian toast.jpeg" width="250" alt="columbia toast">
    <p>Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive under the shade of
        banana trees in the tropical climate. Because of Colombia’s high altitude, it also shapes the way the bean
        grows.
        While the country produces a crazy amount of coffee, it actually exports a lot of its best beans. While going to
        Colombia for your next brew is an awesome idea, you can also get your hands on the beans and brew them at home!
