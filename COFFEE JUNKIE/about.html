    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has
        a
        stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world
        market for
        hot drinks.
        The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are
        roasted and
        then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a
        cup of
        coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and
        presented in a
        variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar
        substitutes,
        milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
